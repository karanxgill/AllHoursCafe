### Steps to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio
3. Update the connection string in `appsettings.json` if needed
4. Configure email settings in `appsettings.json` for password reset functionality:
   ```json
   "EmailSettings": {
     "SenderName": "All Hours Cafe",
     "SenderEmail": "your-email@example.com",
     "SmtpServer": "smtp.example.com",
     "Port": 587,
     "Username": "your-smtp-username",
     "Password": "your-smtp-password",
     "UseSsl": true
   }
   ```

   For Gmail, use these settings:
   ```json
   "EmailSettings": {
     "SenderName": "All Hours Cafe",
     "SenderEmail": "your-gmail@gmail.com",
     "SmtpServer": "smtp.gmail.com",
     "Port": 587,
     "Username": "your-gmail@gmail.com",

5. Run the following commands in Package Manager Console:
   ```
   Update-Database
   ```
6. Run the application (F5 or Ctrl+F5)

## SuperAdmin Access
When you run the application for the first time and apply database migrations, a SuperAdmin account is automatically created with the following credentials:

- **Email**: superadmin@allhourscafe.com
- **Password**: SuperAdmin@123

These credentials can be used to access the admin dashboard with full administrative privileges. For security reasons, it's **strongly recommended** to change the default password immediately after your first login.

The application implements a hierarchical role system with three levels:

### SuperAdmin
- Highest level with full administrative privileges
